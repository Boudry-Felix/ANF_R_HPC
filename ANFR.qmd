title: "ANF R for HPC"
---

This formation focused on creating and optimizing R scripts for High Performance Computing (HPC) environments.

Several tools were presented and discussed:

- [`Rmpi`](https://github.com/GroupeCalcul/ANFRCalculRmpi/tree/5450db63710bad878e2d5155395b8a5b3f59e23b) for parallel computing
- [`futureverse`](https://github.com/astamm/anf-rhpc-futureverse/tree/8a261c69b97562bc539f9d7208c84c689e830d5c) for asynchronous programming
- [`snakemake`](https://github.com/fchuffar/demo_snakemake/tree/5cc12182c39b998db7b5c17d91b2b93c91b891c2) for workflow management
- [`rcpp`](https://github.com/Boudry-Felix/ANF_R_HPC/blob/main/rcpp_hpc) for C++ integration and it's [parallelisable version](https://github.com/astamm/parallel-rcpp/tree/9ce2c680b82d724e1c14b2c6c1fc94a8852ec519)
- [`rkeops`](https://github.com/Boudry-Felix/ANF_R_HPC/blob/main/r-gpu-rkeops) for GPU computing
